# Custom OAuth Connections

## Create the OAuth Connection in the Dashboard

First the user needs to create a new connection by using the `Custom Social Connections` [extension](https://manage.auth0.com/#/extensions), filling every required field before saving the changes.

## Customize the Style in Lock

To customize OAuth connections you can call the builder passing both the `connectionName` and the `style` to use.

First create a custom style extending `Lock.Theme.AuthStyle` and define the logo, background color and name of the connection.

```xml
<style name="Style.Facebook" parent="Lock.Theme.AuthStyle">
    <item name="Auth0.BackgroundColor">@color/facebook_color</item>
    <item name="Auth0.Name">@string/facebook_name</item>
    <item name="Auth0.Logo">@drawable/facebook_logo</item>
</style>
```

Now in the builder's setup add the AuthStyle for the connection name that you want to override.

```java
builder.withAuthStyle("facebook", R.style.Style_Facebook)
        .build(...);
```

When *Lock* needs to display that connection in a SocialButton, it will first search for user-overridden styles, and if none are found, it will default to the Lock social defaults. This means that for "facebook" it will use Facebook background color, Facebook logo and "FACEBOOK" as name.

As the builder method receives the `connectionName` you can now customize `oauth2` strategy type connections. The default values for this strategy are: Auth0 logo, Auth0 background color, and "OAUTH2" as name.
